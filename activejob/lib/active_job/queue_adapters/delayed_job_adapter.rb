    # == Delayed Job adapter for Active Job

    # Delayed::Job (or DJ) encapsulates the common pattern of asynchronously
    # executing longer tasks in the background. Although DJ can have many
    # storage backends, one of the most used is based on Active Record.
    # Read more about Delayed Job {here}[https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job].

    # To use Delayed Job, set the queue_adapter config to +:delayed_job+.
